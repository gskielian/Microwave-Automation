Microwave-Automation
====================

Using a relay-controlled microwave to evaluate the suitability of pyserial for robotic and data-logging applications.




### Template for future pyserial and serial readings

Also wanted to test out how responsive pyserial could be, so that we may evaluate suitability for robotic arm control as well as evaluate pyserial's reliability for the purposes of  scientific data logging.

Thanks [treeherder](https://github.com/treeherder) for the tip to prompting the Arduino before prining data to serial! -- now the fidelity of the output is awesome (while maintaining really fast responsivity)!
