Microwave-Automation
====================

I hope to create a clean interface for microwave.






### Template for future pyserial and serial readings

Also wanted to test out how responsive pyserial could be, so that we may evaluate suitability for robotic arm control as well as evaluate it's reliability for the purposes of  scientific data logging.
Thanks [treeherder](https://github.com/treeherder) for the tip for prompting the Arduino to send output -- now the responsiveness is awesome!
