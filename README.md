Microwave-Automation
====================

I hope to create a clean interface for microwave.






### Template for future pyserial and serial readings

Also wanted to test out how responsive pyserial could be, so that we may evaluate suitability for robotic arm control as well as evaluate pyserial's reliability for the purposes of  scientific data logging.

I need thank [treeherder](https://github.com/treeherder) for his tip for prompting the Arduino to send output -- now the Arduino responds super quickly!
